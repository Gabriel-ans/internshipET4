macquarie university internship : signal processing and image processing project 

1 Introduction

This research project aims to explore the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using fluorescent nanoparticles and the zebrafish model. The goal of the project is to understand how nanocarriers
of drugs can cross the BBB and reach the brain under various conditions. By tracking single Green
Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in live zebrafish, the project seeks to visualize and analyze the behavior
of these nanocarriers, shedding light on the mechanisms and challenges associated with drug delivery
to the brain. This project will help to improve our understanding of BBB permeability and explore
strategies to improve the administration of drugs to the brain for the diagnosis and treatment of brain
disorders.
